                <p>The worlds of Terraria are dangerous and it is your goal to explore every nook and cranny and find
                    what treasure awaits inside.

                </p> <br>
                <p>
                <h3>Biomes</h3>
                <p>
                    Many different biomes make the lands of Terraria. Common ones like the <b>Snow</b>, <b>Desert</b> or <b>Jungle</b>
                    biomes contain deeper more dangerous underground areas.
                    Be careful when explore. There are as many dangerous enemies creeping around dark corners as there ores
                    and treasure to be found.
                </p>
                </p><br>

                <h3>Evil Biomes & The Dungeon</h3>
                <p> There are also the <b>Evil Biomes</b>, you chose which one you have, or picked randomly, when you
                    first made the world. There is the purple <b>Corruption</b> and the red <b>Crimson</b>.
                    Early on they are filled with dangerous and fast flying enemies that will try to chase you. They both have
                    unique landscapes, enemies, drops, and even bosses.
                    <b>The Corruption</b> looks like a giant worm dug through its land, and there are many worm like enemies
                    that apear their. While <b>The Crimson</b> is more straightforward with cave entrances
                    and a large area full of creatures underneath.
                </p><br>

                </div>

                <br>
                <p> <b>The Dungeon</b> is unique as you have to beat a boss, <i><a href="./progression.html#tron">Skeletron</a></i>,
                    before you can enter it. It looks like
                    an underground castle filled with skeleton themed enemies trying to get you.
                    More foes appear as well because of the blue candle lights that surround the dungeon which increases
                    enemy spawn rate. So be quick when you're exploring! Find big slimes enemies who contain <i>golden keys</i>,
                    you will need them to open the <i>golden chests</i> scattered around the Dungeon and get amazing weapons and loot.
                </p><br>

                <h3> The Underworld</h3>
                <p> The ever infamous <b>Underworld</b> biome located at the bottom of the world. It's one of most dangerous
                    places in the game, as it is filled with lava and devilish enemies. Make sure you are prepared to explore this dangerous place!
                    I recommend you stall going this deep down until you've explored the Dungeon, upgraded your health
                    by finding several Heart Crystal which are littered around the world, and getting sufficiently
                    geared up.
                    Make sure to raid the buildings that circle the center of The Underworld it is filled with good
                    chests with loot that you won't want to miss. However they are locked! So must find the <b>Shadow Key</b>
                    in one of the chests located in <i>the Dungeon.</i>
                    This is also where you defeat the <i><a href="./progression.html#flesh">Wall of Flesh</a></i>, the last boss
                    you fight before you start Hardmode.
