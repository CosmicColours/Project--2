            <div class="container wrapper">
                <p> As you explore around the world you might encounter bosses, boss spawners, and even events that act
                    like raids of enemies
                    coming to attack you. It might seem scary and they might appear when your not prepared, most often
                    they appear at night.
                    But, it's in your best interest to beat them as they most often either drop very good items upon
                    death that let you become stronger, or
                    unlock more parts of the world and game. Here are some notable examples.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h3>King Slime</h3>

            <img src="images/slime.gif" class="gif">
            <p>One of the first bosses that you can randomly encounter while playing the game. He can also be
                encountered during the Slime Rain even where
                loads of slimes starts raining down from the sky. After the 150th slime is defeated he will appear.
                He is the easiest boss in the game with his only
                attacks being jumping, spawning slimes, and teleporting around to reach the player. Be careful when he's
                teleporting though, he much just appear
                right on top of you!
                <br><br>Notable items you may get when defeating him is the Slimy Saddle, which is a mount accessory
                that lets you ride on huge slime and jump real high, and the Slime Hook which
                let's you hook onto walls which is helpful for exploring underground.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Eye of Cthulhu</h3>
            <img src="images/eye.gif" class="gif">
            <p>This boss may appear at any night even when you're not prepared. You'll know when it will appear when
                your status log says <i>"You feel an evil presence watching you..." </i>.
                It can also be spawned by using a Suspicious Looking Eye which can found insides chests found in the
                abandoned underground houses you find while exploring. <br><br>
                Its main mode of attacking is charging at you at high speeds, so be quick! Before the night comes try
                making an long elevated arena using platforms as it give you more room to dodge, you may even
                go up and down as you'd like to try and get out of the way. <br> <br>
                It drops either Demonite or Crimtane, depending on the Evile biome you chose, upon defeat among other
                things. These are great for crafting weapons and armour for future enemy encounters.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Skeletron</h3>
            <img src="images/skele.gif" class="gif">
            <p>The way you spawn this boss is quite unique. You must talk to the Old Man located at the entrance of the
                Dungeon at night and once you press the <i>"Curse"</i> option
                the boss fight starts. <br><br>This boss might be difficult to beat as it is made of three parts. Its
                two hands and the main head. I recommend before you start the fight to create an elevate arena
                using platforms nearby the Dungeon. Again, this good to do for most boss fights if you can as it gives
                you more room to dodge and move around. During the boss fight try
                attacking and taking out the hands first as it is faster and harder to dodge with them around. With the
                hands gone and the head alone it's easier to focus on the one thing attack you. <br><br>
                While defeating this boss might give you good items the real prize is being able to enter the Dungeon,
                as there some good weapons and loot hidden beneath its chests.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Wall of Flesh</h3>
            <img src="images/wall.gif" class="gif">
            <p>This boss is located in The Underworld and is quite unique in its spawning requirements and its
                mechanics. It can be spawned by dropping a Guide Voodoo Doll, which can be dropped on occation by a
                Voodoo Demon
                that lives in the Underworld, into lava in the Underworld.<br><br> Be prepared to run once you do,
                because it will appear at the side where you're closest to the edge of the world and come tumbling
                towards with no
                end in sight. The unique mechanic to this boss is that it will keep moving in a certain direction while
                blocking the way to the other side, as a wall
                usually does. You'll have to keep running at the same direction while your fighting it. I recommend
                before spawning to be to create a very long bridge
                across the Underworld so you have an easier time traversing the land as you fight. It is also best to
                spawn it in either the very left or right side, whichever you prefer,
                of the world as it gives you more room to fight the boss, because as soon as you reach the edge of the
                world you'll be crushed.
                <br> <br> Once you defeat it you may gain many powerful weapons and items from its drops, but the most
                important thing that happens after its defeat is the start of Hardmode.
                Hardmode is a continuation but with a harder and more powerful world. You are now able to fight harder
                bosses which were previously not encounterable before. New biomes, treasure, and ores
                may appear. Hardmode is a more advanced part of the game.
